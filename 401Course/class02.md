# Arrays, Loops, Imports

## Package:

 **package = directory**


You can compile more than one Java file in one place by importing packages

`>` There are three levels of packet definition

* Package statement: Identifies the package of the class itself
* Imports: import categories from other files
* Class or interface definitions: for the class


`>>` The import can be for an entire class or a private part of it, or even the full name of the class can be satisfied on the line I want to use it in..
`>` Using any of them does not affect memory.
`>` The order doesn't matter
`>` There are classes that do not need to be called, such as String and system

## LOOPs:

Loop is a type of programming command that is used when needed to execute programming statements a number of times according to a specific condition

`>>` Java provides different types of loops, each with a special use:

  * For Loop: Used when the number of iterations is known in terms of start and end..
  * While Loop: Used when the number of times the code is executed is unknown, dependent on the fulfillment of a condition.
* Do-While Loop: Similar to while with the exception that the code is executed at least once even if the condition is not met.
