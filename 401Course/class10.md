# Stacks & Queues

### What is a Stack?

* Push => put items into the stack
* Pop => remove items from the stack.
* Top => This is the top of the stack.
* Peek => view the value of the top Node in the stack.
* IsEmpty => returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.


> Stacks follow :
**(FILO) First In Last Out**
> 
> 
> This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
