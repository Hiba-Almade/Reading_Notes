**What is Serverless Architecture? What are its Pros and Cons?**
* Serverless - is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages of servers.
* Traditional vs. Serverless Architecture
    - Traditionally - applications have run on servers which you had to patch, update, and continuously look after late nights and early mornings due to all the unimaginable errors that broke your production.
    - Serverless - no longer need to worry about the underlying servers, and can be worked on at anytime.
* Serverless is reduced cost.

    - When asked if you have a schema, say No
    - Select one of the default samples; you can change this later
    - Choose to edit the schema, and it will open the new schema.graphql in your editor
    - Save the file and hit enter in your terminal window. if no error messages are thrown this means the transformation was successful and you can deploy your new API.
