### Android Monetization

#### Choose a monetization model for your app:

* To maximize your revenue, consider a flexible monetization strategy that adapts to your audiences and markets. Different audiences can have different preferences for paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, ads, and other ecommerce.

* Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay
    - Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside your app. Provides your customers a faster, safer way to pay online. Speeds up your checkout process, as users won't need to enter their payment details each time or when they first download your app.
    - products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include: retail merchandise, physical services, one-time membership fees or recurring dues, and electronic bill payment.
