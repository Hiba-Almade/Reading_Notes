# OOP:

### What is the object?
Because we use programming to make our real world easier.. Every real object can be represented by a programming object that has a state and behavior

`>>`Through the class we form a primitive structure of the object.

    public class Bicycle {
        
    // the Bicycle class has
    // three fields
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
        
    // the Bicycle class has
    // one constructor
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }

**If** we have a set of objects that are combined with characteristics and behaviors.

---> Its organization can be facilitated by inheritance, building a base object and deriving others from it

`>>` Class group can be organized using the package

----

### What is the interface?

The interface is a contract between the code and the outside world .. where the results of operations are shown in an understandable way for any user

--------------
### Numbers system:

#### Decimals:
a decimal number has a "position" ,it also called "Base 10":

`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9`

#### Binary Numbers:

"Base 2" numbers instead of "Base 10" , so  its has just `0 and1` numbers.

#### Hexadecimal Numbers:

"Base 16",  they look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters `("A',"B","C","D","E","F")` in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
