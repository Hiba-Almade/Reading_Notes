## JS Event:

### What is an Event ?
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

* Events are the browser's way of indicating when 
something has happened (such as when a page has 
finished loading or a button has been clicked). 
* Binding is the process of stating which event you are 
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting 
for that event to happen upon. 
* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a 
JavaScript function. When this function then changes 
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because 
it has responded to the user. 
* You can use event delegation to monitor for events 
that happen on all of the children of an element. 
* The most commonly used events are W3C DOM 
events, although there are others in the HTMLS 
specification as well as browser-specific events.
