# **CSS** 
### Cascading Style Sheets
 fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. 

## There are three ways you can use to implement CSS:
 ### Internal CSS

 Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML document.

### External CSS
With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file
This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.

### Inline CSS
Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.
