# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML list:
Sometimes we may need to mention the steps to do something, or make a list of some items..

***There are three types of HTML lists:***

* Unordered lists, shown as bullets
* Ordered lists, numbered
* Definition lists, to write down a set of definitions in an orderly fashion.

> Also, several lists can be nested within each other.

## CSS Box Model:
In Css each element has its own **box**..
Like a transparent box surrounding the item
* We can show the limits of this box
We can put borders in different shapes, patterns, and colors
* Height and width control is easy
* Adding padding and spaces is also possible
* Round and shadow borders can be made
* Item boxes may be nested to look neat

> Pictures are also treated like a box, as they have their actual limits of length and width.

## JS Control Flow:
* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

* **if ... else** statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* **switch** statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while Each repeats a set of statements.
