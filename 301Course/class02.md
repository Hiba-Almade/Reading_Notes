# React Component Lifecycle Events

***React lets you define components as classes or functions.***

Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. 
In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold.


### These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

* Constructor
* Render
* React Updates 
* ComponentDidMount & componentWillUnmount
