# Mongo and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

* SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.
* SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
* SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
* SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
* SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.


##  What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions.

### Give a real world example.
the student info or prodacts info

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database technology stores information in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used by relational databases. To be clear, NoSQL stands for “not only SQL” rather than “no SQL” at all.

### Give a real world example.

Email info Or any json data

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Nosql dtabase

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
Nosql database

## What does SQL stand for?

SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.

## What is a realational database?


A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. ... The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A traditional and widely-used data structure is called "B-tree." B-tree structures.

## What is a ‘schema’?


A schema is a model for describing the structure of information. It's a term borrowed from the database world to describe the structure of data in relational tables. ... A schema might also be viewed as an agreement on a common vocabulary for a particular application that involves exchanging documents.

## What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL is an approach to database management that can accommodate a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, columnar and graph formats. A NoSQL database generally means that it is non-relational, distributed, flexible and scalable. ... Today it is commonly accepted that NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL."

## how nosql database works?


NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.


MongoDB is faster than MySQL due to its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data when it comes to speed. It uses slave replication, master replication to process vast amounts of unstructured data and offers the freedom to use multiple data types that are better than the rigidity of MySQL.

While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.


## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

* NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have

`>` This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability..

* This may reduce the number of safe applications that commit transactions, for example bank systems.

`>` NoSQL is not compatible (at all) with SQL.

* This means that you will need a manual query language, making things slower and more complex.

* NoSQL are very new compared to Relational Databases, which means that are far less stable and may have a lot less functionalities.
