# HTML text, CSS introduction, and basic JavaScript help


## **HTML**:

As we talked about before, there are a lot of elements that can be added to a web page using HTML..
There are some tags that are used to improve the appearance of the page without adding content, such as:

* `<sup> , <sub>` superscript and subchart
* `<br/>` dividing line
* `<hr />` break between topics
* Semantic markup:
    * `<strong>` to make bold text
    * `<em>` Italic text
    * etc....

## **CSS**:
This style of elements is used to adjust how the elements appear on the web page .. such as color or size, frame or borders, spacing and dimensions ..

Usually these commands are written in a separate HTML file, but they can be written inside it.
CSS adds the aesthetic that may attract the user to the website.

## **JavaScript**: 
The code is a set of sentences. Each sentence is an important step that cannot be skipped.
They are very accurate and run sequentially from the beginning to the end of the file.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. JavaScript can distinguish between types of variables, a number of text or a boolean value
*Arrays* can also be used as a type of variable that stores more than one piece of information and more than one value in the same place.
> Lots of details are present in javascript, some of them are like magic
> **Function, object, loop, conditions, etc**.
