### What is the **Java Script** ?
JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.

> To start learning JavaScript you should take a look at some of the basics:


***Java Script Variable:***

 Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.

JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.

****Java Script Operator:***
 An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.

 ***Java Script Conditional:***

 Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

***additional information:***
* As a JavaScript programmer you can track the health of the program using:
**control.log()** to print to the JavaScript console. The JavaScript console record functionality is mainly used to debug code errors because it makes JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click the page and select Inspect, then click Console.
* For Write some text directly to the HTML document use **document.write();**
* Or show it as a temporary and quick message
  The **alert()** method displays an alert box with
  a specified message and an OK button.
* If you want to ask the user to enter some information first, use the **prompt()** method.
