# **Function with JavaScript**

#### Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again.
> JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages.

>In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.

### Defining functions:
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

### Invoking a JavaScript Function: 
* The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined.

* The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.

* It is common to use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function".
