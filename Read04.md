# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML Links:

*A website is not just one page.*

* How do we move from one page to another within the site?
* How do we move to another site?
* How to move between parts of the same page?
* How do we send emails from websites?

**All this is done using the ***link tag*****

`>>` In `<a>` we put the link inside a property called `href` to specify where we want to go.

`>>` We use the `url` of other pages

`>>` We use to to send an email

`>>`We use id as a sign when navigating within the same page.

## Intro to CSS Layout:

*Each item is in its own box..*

A group of elements may be placed in a common box that is like a **parent** to them like `<div>`

Pages are in a normal flow format unless the properties are changed:
* Move items to the right or left.
* Putting items on top of each other.
* Change the height and width of each element.

`>>` **There are three types of flow:**

1. Normal flow:
    
    It is by default where each item is on a separate line even if the item width is changed.

2. Relative positioning:

    Change the position of the element in its place. Up or down, left or right..without affecting the other elements on the page.

3. absolute positioning:

    The element has moved out of its place and can be placed on top of other elements without affecting them.. as it appears to float on top of them.

> The web page should fit all devices, so the elements are extensible.

`>>` CSS provides a framework that helps to perfectly control the locations of the elements.

## JS Functions:

*Functions are used to put a set of code loads in one block.They are called when needed without repeating all the code again..*

* The function must have a name that indicates what you are doing
* The function is called by its name only.
* A parameter can be added to send some values that I need in executing code.
