A wireframe is a low fidelity representation of a web page that shows the basic elements of the page. They are not interactive, and do not show much detail, but create a simple design that guides the project. Once it starts becoming interactive, it becomes a prototype.

**What to Include in a Wireframe?**

Think about general elements when you plan every webpage: header, footer, sidebar and content areas. Then, think of additional elements: navigation bars, widgets, buttons.
Once you have an idea of the elements, you can now start creating your wireframe.

> *All elements in the wireframe are usually displayed and organised to consider the following:*

* What will exactly be displayed in this page?
* How will the elements of this page be put together?
* How will these elements be displayed in positioning, labelling and size?
* How will these elements work together?
* How does these elements interact with the user?

> Types of Wireframes:

* Sketchy
* Digital

**After completing this stage and being convinced ..
We start the implementation and build pages with HTML**

## So, What's the HTML?

**HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

> The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
