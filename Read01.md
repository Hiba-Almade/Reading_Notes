## HTML:
#### HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
#### With HTML you can create your own Website.
#### HTML is easy to learn.

### **Html structure:**
*An HTML 4 document is composed of three parts:*
* a line containing HTML version information `DOCTYPE`.
* a declarative `header` section (delimited by the HEAD element),
* a `body`, which contains the document's actual content. The body may be implemented by the BODY element.

> To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

### **HTML Extra Markup:**
* Each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.
* An HTML comment begins with `<! –– and the comment closes with ––>` . HTML comments are visible to anyone that views the page source code, but are not rendered when the HTML document is rendered by a browser.
* The HTML **id** attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element .You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.
* Class in html:
  * The class is an attribute which specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.
  * The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
  * The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the specified class name.

* Symbols that are not present on your keyboard can also be added by using entities. To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.

### **HTML layout:**

HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.
> Every website has a specific layout to display content in a specific manner.

*Following are different HTML5 elements which are used to define the different parts of a webpage.*
* `<header>`: It is used to define a header for a document or a section.
* `<nav>`: It is used to define a container for navigation links
* `<section>`: It is used to define a section in a document
* `<article>`: It is used to define an independent self-contained article
* `<aside>`: It is used to define content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
* `<footer>`: It is used to define a footer for a document or a section
* `<details>`: It is used to define additional details
* `<summary>`: It is used to define a heading for the <details> element

### **HTML Process and Design:**
Well-designed websites offer much more than just aesthetics. They attract visitors and help people understand the product, company, and branding through a variety of indicators, encompassing visuals, text, and interactions. That means every element of your site needs to work towards a defined goal.
*But how can you achieve this harmonious synthesis of the elements?* Through a comprehensive web design process that takes both form and function into account.

***Website design steps:***
* `Defining a goal`: What is the purpose of a website
* `Scope definition`: What web pages and features the site requires to achieve the goal, and the timeline for building those features.
* `Create a sitemap and wireframe`: Determine how the content and features we defined in the domain definition relate to.
* `Content Creation`: It is essential to have real content to work with in the next phase
* `Visual elements`: with the site structure and some content in place. Tools like pattern boxes, mood boards, and item collages can help with this process.
* `Test`: It's time to make sure that all of the site's pages are working properly.
* `Launch`: Once everything is working beautifully, it's time to plan and implement your site launch!

## JavaScript:

### **What is a script and how do I create it?**
*By itself, HTML doesn’t have any smarts*: It can’t do math, it can’t figure out if someone has correctly filled out a form, and it can’t make decisions based on how a web visitor interacts with it.

Basically, HTML lets people read text, look at pictures, watch videos, and click links to move to other web pages with more text, pictures, and videos. In order to add intelligence to your web pages so they can respond to your site’s visitors, you need JavaScript.

**JavaScript** lets a web page react intelligently. With it, you can create smart web forms that let visitors know when they’ve forgotten to include necessary information. You can make elements appear, disappear, or move around a web page. You can even update the contents of a web page with information retrieved from a web server—without having to load a new web page.
> In short, JavaScript lets you make your websites more engaging, effective, and useful.

### **How do computers fit in with the world around them?**

Computers create models, examples, and locations of the world using data.
Programmers can devise and write code to suit all cases and conditions to say `"When this event occurs, do this action and display this output"`.
Conditionals and others do this job to make websites as interactive as possible.

### **How do I write a script for a web page?**

* **Create a JavaScript file:**

  In your project, in the same folder as your `index.html` page, create a new file called `app.js`. All of your project’s JavaScript code should be written in `.js` files.

* **Add some test code to the file:**

  In your new file `app.js`, add the code.

* **Add the file to your web page:**

  In your `index.html` file, add a script tag to load your new JavaScript. The script tag should be the last line of code before your closing body tag.
  
> This is the line you need to add:
`<script src="app.js"></script>`.
